        <p>Assistance League&reg; of Colorado Springs is a nonprofit organization that helps students and families in El Paso County. &nbsp;This year, we will again be partnering with Kohl&rsquo;s at 3110 N. Powers Blvd to provide school clothing for students
            in kindergarten through twelfth grades.</p>
        <p>Please try to arrive at your scheduled time, as you will not be able to shop if you arrive after 5:00 p.m. (weekdays) or 10:30 a.m. (Saturdays) on your scheduled day. If you are unable to shop on your scheduled day, please contact your school
            counselor to reschedule. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>There will be a yellow plastic figure at the north door where you will enter and register. Only students who have a schoolbell passport signed by a parent or guardian will be served. <strong>Siblings will not be served unless their school has provided a Passport for them.</strong></li>
            <li>Students shopping must wear the wristband given to them to designate their money allotment.</li>
            <li>Only school clothing may be purchased for students. &nbsp;No hats, jewelry, or purses may be purchased. </li>
            <li>Schoolbell-specific cash registers will be at the south end of the store; you may only check out with these designated cashiers. &nbsp;You may not use any coupons for your School Bell purchases or receive Kohl&rsquo;s Cash. If you are under
                your allotted amount, you may only return to the shopping floor <strong>one time</strong> to add items to your purchase. &nbsp;If your purchase exceeds the designated amount, it will be your decision whether to pay any extra amount, up
                to $20.00, or not purchase all the clothing selected.</li>
            <li>You will need to shop carefully as no items can be exchanged. &nbsp;You will not receive a receipt for the purchase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Kohl&rsquo;s employees will not be able to answer specific questions concerning Operation School Bell. You may call the store on Sep 9-12, 16-19, 23-26, and Oct 1-3 between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m. or Sep 14, 21, 28 between &nbsp;8:00 and 10:00 a.m.
